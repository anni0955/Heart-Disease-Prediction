# Heart-Disease-Prediction

 This model predicts whether a person has heart disease or not. This model gives its prediction by reading the values of these columns: age, sex, cp, chol, tresrtbps, bs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal.

I also tried many visualizations which gave me a good understanding of the dataset. I standardscaled all the columns to reduce the calculation of the model. I tried my test input on 2 models(Logistic Regression and KNeighborsClassifier) and I got accuracy_score of 88.33% in both the cases. I also tried corss_val_score to cross_vary it.
